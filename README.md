# Climate-Change-Whitepapers
This is a repository of whitepapers that I have read. Climate Change is my generations biggest problem, and I believe, though it is a bit abstract, it's humanity's greatest challenge. This is here to showcase the knowledge I have consumed from the climate scientists in the fields, providing credibility to the product solutions I create.
The goal is to provide credibility to my product and system solutions by showing the breadth of peer-reviewed research that informs my work.

## 📚 Whitepapers Read

### Cryosphere & Polar Systems
- [Impacts of Antarctic Summer Sea-Ice Extremes](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf164) — Doddridge et al., *PNAS Nexus*, 2025  
  _Explores how extreme lows in Antarctic sea ice affect ecosystems, ocean heat uptake, ice-shelf stability, and Antarctic logistics._

- [An Observational Constraint for Future Greenland Rain in a Warmer Atmosphere](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL114710) — Thompson-Munson et al., *GRL*, 2025  
  _Finds that just 2.3°C warming could double rainfall over Greenland’s ice sheet, amplifying melt and sea level rise._

### Agriculture & Food Systems
- [Earlier Planting Fails to Replicate Historical Production Conditions for US Spring Wheat](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02716-0) — Savalkar et al., *Communications Earth & Environment*, 2025  
  _Shows that planting earlier will not offset heat stress impacts on U.S. spring wheat; 67% of wheat production regions remain highly vulnerable._

### Climate Tipping Points
- [High Probability of Triggering Climate Tipping Points Under Current Policies](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-16-565-2025) — Deutloff, Held & Lenton, *Earth System Dynamics*, 2025  
  _Estimates a >60% probability of crossing multiple tipping points under current policies (SSP2-4.5), with Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw amplifying risks._

### Climate Sensitivity
- [Seeing the Forest for the Trees](https://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2025/ForestTrees.06August2025.pdf) — Hansen & Kharecha, 2025  
  _Argues that equilibrium climate sensitivity is closer to 4.8°C for doubled CO₂, far higher than IPCC’s central estimate, due to underestimated cloud feedbacks._
