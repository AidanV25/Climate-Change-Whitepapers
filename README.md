# Climate-Change-Whitepapers
This is a repository of whitepapers that I have read. Climate Change is my generations biggest problem, and I'd state, though it is a bit abstract, I believe it's humanity's greatest challenge. This is here to provide insights into the research that I am keeping up to date with; giving depth into why I come up with the solutions I propose.

## üìö Whitepapers Read

### Cryosphere & Polar Systems
- [Impacts of Antarctic Summer Sea-Ice Extremes](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf164) ‚Äî Doddridge et al., *PNAS Nexus*, 2025  
  _Explores how extreme lows in Antarctic sea ice affect ecosystems, ocean heat uptake, ice-shelf stability, and Antarctic logistics._

- [An Observational Constraint for Future Greenland Rain in a Warmer Atmosphere](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL114710) ‚Äî Thompson-Munson et al., *GRL*, 2025  
  _Summary: In this paper, they used data from 2006-2020, from the CloudStat satellite, to showcase that ~6% of percipitation falls onto the greenland ice sheet as rain, however, that is mainly on elevations under 1500m. From this data they extrapolated future warming scenarios of 2.3¬∞C, 7.3¬∞C and 10.7¬∞C and found that the amount of rainfall to snowfall would not only increase to above 50%, but it'd begin heavily affecting the higher elevetaion areas. From this, they conclude that the rain will percolate into the deeper bed of the glacier causing an acceleration of ice flow, OR, if that first conclusion is wrong, then what will form pools on the ice sheet, decreasing the albedo, or in plain english, it'll make the glacier more exposed to the sun ie melt._



### Agriculture & Food Systems
- [Earlier Planting Fails to Replicate Historical Production Conditions for US Spring Wheat](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02716-0) ‚Äî Savalkar et al., *Communications Earth & Environment*, 2025  
  _Shows that planting earlier will not offset heat stress impacts on U.S. spring wheat; 67% of wheat production regions remain highly vulnerable._

- [Climate extremes, food price spikes, and their wider societal risks.pdf](https://github.com/userattachments/files/22026067/Climate.extremes.food.price.spikes.and.their.wider.societal.risks.pdf)
  _On my To-Read 



### Climate Effects (Tipping Points)
- [High probability of triggering climate tipping points under current policies modestly amplified by Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw (PDF)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22027978/High.probability.of.triggering.climate.tipping.points.under.current.policies.modestly.amplified.by.Amazon.dieback.and.permafrost.thaw.pdf) - Deutloff, Held & Lenton, *Earth System Dynamics*, 2025  
_Summary: This paper examined how under SSP2-4.5 there exists a critical threshold where carbon emissions from tipping elements (TEs) begin to balance and amplify anthropogenic CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The authors assessed probabilities of different TEs being triggered across scenarios, showing that SSP1-1.9 carries relatively low risk, whereas SSP2-4.5 exhibits a high probability of abrupt or even catastrophic tipping, making it an especially dangerous pathway. They conclude that SSP2-4.5 represents a paradoxical state: while not the highest-emission scenario, it locks the Earth system into long-term warming as TEs such as Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw continue driving feedbacks over the next 500 years. In contrast, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 reflect outright planetary destruction, where TEs merely accelerate an already devastating trajectory._


- [Unprecedentdly high global forest disturbance due to fire in 2023 & 2024.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22026092/Unprecedentdly.high.global.forest.disturbance.due.to.fire.in.2023.2024.pdf)


- [Increasing risk of global forest loss from extreme wildfires under climate change (PDF)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22028277/Increasing.risk.of.global.forest.loss.from.extreme.wildfires.under.climate.change.pdf) - Huang, Wu, Zhang, Geng & Qu, *International Journal of Digital Earth*, 2025  
_Summary: This paper highlighted how, over the study period from 2011‚Äì2023, both the volume and size of wildfires have been increasing, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the Boreal Forest. Burned volume has risen most in the Northern Hemisphere (40‚Äì60¬∞N), while fire size has expanded most in the Southern Hemisphere (10‚Äì30¬∞S). The authors also noted an increase in new forest growth in cooler, wetter northern regions; however, these areas become additional fuel sources during recurring hot‚Äìdry anomalies, which typically last 1‚Äì2 years. To conclude, the paper underscores a critical issue not only for wildlife and global forest stability, but also for broader ecosystem and agricultural resilience, as similar dynamics may manifest in crop systems._



### Climate Sensitivity
- [Seeing the forest for the trees.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22081374/Seeing.the.forest.for.the.trees.pdf) ‚Äî Hansen & Kharecha, 2025  
  _Summary: Argues that equilibrium climate sensitivity is closer to 4.8¬∞C for doubled CO‚ÇÇ, far higher than IPCC‚Äôs central estimate, due to underestimated cloud feedbacks. Back when climate when cliamte modeling began, the estimate of 3.0¬∞C with a +/- of 1.5¬∞C was the estimate, but it came with a 50% confidence, which in scintific terms, is low. Through time, James Hansen, through empirical evidence and new calcualtions on the affects of mainly clouds(which give a higher solar reflectivity called albedo) and aerosols(which also give a reflective effect) has shown to be dampening the true effects of the increase of CO‚ÇÇ. This leads to the conclusion that we have been underestimating how much warming will occur due to a doubling of CO‚ÇÇ._
  
- [Global Warming has Accelerated Significantly.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22094758/Global.Warming.has.Accelerated.Significantly.pdf) - Rahmstorf & Foster, 2025  
  _Summary: In this short paper, the authors use a statistical analysis (piece-wise linear split w/ a LOWESS smooth & change point analysis) to showcase that without the 3 drivers of climate variability: solar radiance, volcanic aerosols and, the El Nino, the earth is accelerating in it's warming from a 0.2¬∞C per decade to 0.4¬∞C per decade. In the paper, a key statement is that they are not sure if this trend is now the new normal, or whether it will slow back down or speed up even more. What they did provde in this paper is proof, with a 95% confidence, which is a key number in science, that this warming increase from 1980-2024, has occured. Which if we come back to climate sensitivity, and Hansen's empirical work, would match the findings that the climate sensitivity may indeed be lower than we previously estimated._
