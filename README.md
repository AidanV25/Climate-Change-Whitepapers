# Climate-Change-Whitepapers
This is a repository of whitepapers that I have recently read (and started tracking). Climate Change is my generations biggest problem, and I'd state, though it is a bit abstract, I believe it's humanity's greatest challenge. This is here to provide insights into the research that I am keeping up to date with; giving depth into why I come up with the solutions I propose.

### Cryosphere & Polar Systems
- [Impacts of Antarctic summer sea-ice extremes](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22278878/Impacts.of.Antarctic.summer.sea-ice.extremes.pdf) — Doddridge et al., *PNAS Nexus*, 2025  
  _Summary: This paper examines the cascading impacts of extreme Antarctic summer sea-ice loss on ice dynamics, ecosystems, and predators. Rising temperatures accelerate glacial ice loss by breaking up multiyear landfast ice, which normally shields ice shelves from warm ocean water; once gone, calving and melt increase sharply. While models suggested quick rebounds after low-ice years, observations showed recovery typically takes around three years, underscoring the nonlinear nature of sea-ice change. For krill and other small organisms, the loss of sea-ice habitat reduces food and shelter for larvae; although their five-year lifespan allows them to withstand a single warm year, consecutive warm years significantly hinder recruitment and population stability. These declines cascade upward, affecting penguins and seals whose survival depends on krill, while shrinking ice platforms also make breeding and chick survival more energy-intensive and the young being able to meet the water at their typical timeline, due to the ice melting faster then they can mature. Overall, the study highlights how they expect a non-linear melting of Antarctica due to calving and rain, having cascading effects on the animals in Antarctica and the overall climate._

- [An Observational Constraint for Future Greenland Rain in a Warmer Atmosphere](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22140194/An.Observational.Constraint.for.Future.Greenland.Rain.in.a.Warmer.Atmosphere.pdf) — Thompson-Munson et al., *GRL*, 2025  
  _Summary: In this paper, they used data from 2006-2020, from the CloudStat satellite, to showcase that ~6% of percipitation falls onto the greenland ice sheet as rain, however, that is mainly on elevations under 1500m. From this data they extrapolated future warming scenarios of 2.3°C, 7.3°C and 10.7°C and found that the amount of rainfall to snowfall would not only increase to above 50%, but it'd begin heavily affecting the higher elevetaion areas. From this, they conclude that the rain will percolate into the deeper bed of the glacier causing an acceleration of ice flow, OR, if that first conclusion is wrong, then the rainfall will form pools on the ice sheet, decreasing the albedo, or in plain english, it'll make the glacier more exposed to the sun ie melt._

- [Arctic amplification ratio into 2100](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22278697/Arctic.amplification.ratio.into.2100.pdf) - Yuzhen Yan, Xinyu Wen, Junyu Mei1 & Xiao-Ming Hu  
    _Summary: The authors in this paper, showcased that the arctic amplification, meaning that the arctic is warming at a faster rate than the rest of the world, not only has a lower ratio of 2.5C +/- 0.8C, compared to the mainstream thinking of 4-7C, but they also showed that as the years move on, the amplification will slow and eventually be in par with the rest of the world. The reason for this, based on their conclusion, was that as the sea ice drops, the albedo of the arctic drops significantly, allowing the warm ocean-atmosphere feedback to accelerate, causing more heating in the arctic region. From this, based on their models, they showcased that not only is this amplification normal, but it has occured in previous glacial and interglacial cycles. My personal note - They used a climate sensitivity of 2.3C, compared to the mean today of 3-4.5C, so their data and modelling is most likely skewed downward becuase of this; or in simple terms: the amplification is probably higher than their 2.5C conclusion, and more towards the 4-7C._




### Agriculture & Food Systems
- [Earlier Planting Fails to Replicate Historical Production Conditions for US Spring Wheat](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02716-0) — Savalkar et al., *Communications Earth & Environment*, 2025  
  _Shows that planting earlier will not offset heat stress impacts on U.S. spring wheat; 67% of wheat production regions remain highly vulnerable._

### Climate Effects (Tipping Points)
- [High probability of triggering climate tipping points under current policies modestly amplified by Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw (PDF)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22027978/High.probability.of.triggering.climate.tipping.points.under.current.policies.modestly.amplified.by.Amazon.dieback.and.permafrost.thaw.pdf) - Deutloff, Held & Lenton, *Earth System Dynamics*, 2025  
_Summary: This paper examined how under SSP2-4.5 there exists a critical threshold where carbon emissions from tipping elements (TEs) begin to balance and amplify anthropogenic CO₂ emissions. The authors assessed probabilities of different TEs being triggered across scenarios, showing that SSP1-1.9 carries relatively low risk, whereas SSP2-4.5 exhibits a high probability of abrupt or even catastrophic tipping, making it an especially dangerous pathway. They conclude that SSP2-4.5 represents a paradoxical state: while not the highest-emission scenario, it locks the Earth system into long-term warming as TEs such as Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw continue driving feedbacks over the next 500 years. In contrast, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 reflect outright planetary destruction, where TEs merely accelerate an already devastating trajectory._


- [Unprecedentdly high global forest disturbance due to fire in 2023 & 2024.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22026092/Unprecedentdly.high.global.forest.disturbance.due.to.fire.in.2023.2024.pdf)


- [Increasing risk of global forest loss from extreme wildfires under climate change (PDF)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22028277/Increasing.risk.of.global.forest.loss.from.extreme.wildfires.under.climate.change.pdf) - Huang, Wu, Zhang, Geng & Qu, *International Journal of Digital Earth*, 2025  
_Summary: This paper highlighted how, over the study period from 2011–2023, both the volume and size of wildfires have been increasing, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the Boreal Forest. Burned volume has risen most in the Northern Hemisphere (40–60°N), while fire size has expanded most in the Southern Hemisphere (10–30°S). The authors also noted an increase in new forest growth in cooler, wetter northern regions; however, these areas become additional fuel sources during recurring hot–dry anomalies, which typically last 1–2 years. To conclude, the paper underscores a critical issue not only for wildlife and global forest stability, but also for broader ecosystem and agricultural resilience, as similar dynamics may manifest in crop systems._


- [Deep learning based reconstructions of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation confirm twenty-first century decline](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22214222/Deep.learning.based.reconstructions.of.the.Atlantic.meridional.overturning.circulation.confirm.twenty-first.century.decline.pdf) - Simon L L Michel, René M van Westen, Etc.  
  _Summary: The authors of this paper, built a new CNN(convolutional neural network) to examine whether the AMOC was showing signs of it slowing, with a conclusion that the predictions of the models, based on real observations, are indeed ocurring. Whether the AMOC is showing signs of tipping is a critical debate in the climate science community, due to it's consequences on the climate. The fundamental issue is that our models haven't been tracking the AMOC as tightly as one would need for the 95% confidence threshold, thus, making it difficult to disprove or prove that the AMOC is slowing/tipping. That's why a paper/research study like this is so important. With their new CNN model, they were able to track the recent observations from the "RAPID" AMOC obesrvations, with a 95% confidence (aka tightly correlated to real world observations), to which they concluded that their model provides "reinforcing confidence in future projections of 21st century AMOC decline."_

### Climate Sensitivity
- [Seeing the forest for the trees.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22081374/Seeing.the.forest.for.the.trees.pdf) — Hansen & Kharecha, 2025  
  _Summary: Argues that equilibrium climate sensitivity is closer to 4.8°C for doubled CO₂, far higher than IPCC’s central estimate, due to underestimated cloud feedbacks. Back when climate when cliamte modeling began, the estimate of 3.0°C with a +/- of 1.5°C was the estimate, but it came with a 50% confidence, which in scintific terms, is low. Through time, James Hansen, through empirical evidence and new calcualtions on the affects of mainly clouds(which give a higher solar reflectivity called albedo) and aerosols(which also give a reflective effect) has shown to be dampening the true effects of the increase of CO₂. This leads to the conclusion that we have been underestimating how much warming will occur due to a doubling of CO₂._
  
- [Global Warming has Accelerated Significantly.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22094758/Global.Warming.has.Accelerated.Significantly.pdf) - Rahmstorf & Foster, 2025  
  _Summary: In this short paper, the authors use a statistical analysis (piece-wise linear split w/ a LOWESS smooth & change point analysis) to showcase that without the 3 drivers of climate variability: solar radiance, volcanic aerosols and, the El Nino, the earth is accelerating in it's warming from a 0.2°C per decade to 0.4°C per decade. In the paper, a key statement is that they are not sure if this trend is now the new normal, or whether it will slow back down or speed up even more. What they did provde in this paper is proof, with a 95% confidence, which is a key number in science, that this warming increase from 1980-2024, has occured. Which if we come back to climate sensitivity, and Hansen's empirical work, would match the findings that the climate sensitivity may indeed be lower than we previously estimated._
