# Climate-Change-Whitepapers
This is a repository of whitepapers that I have read. Climate Change is my generations biggest problem, and I believe, though it is a bit abstract, it's humanity's greatest challenge. This is here to showcase the knowledge I have consumed from the climate scientists in the fields, providing credibility to the product solutions I create.
The goal is to provide credibility to my product and system solutions by showing the breadth of peer-reviewed research that informs my work.

## üìö Whitepapers Read

### Cryosphere & Polar Systems
- [Impacts of Antarctic Summer Sea-Ice Extremes](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf164) ‚Äî Doddridge et al., *PNAS Nexus*, 2025  
  _Explores how extreme lows in Antarctic sea ice affect ecosystems, ocean heat uptake, ice-shelf stability, and Antarctic logistics._

- [An Observational Constraint for Future Greenland Rain in a Warmer Atmosphere](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL114710) ‚Äî Thompson-Munson et al., *GRL*, 2025  
  _Finds that just 2.3¬∞C warming could double rainfall over Greenland‚Äôs ice sheet, amplifying melt and sea level rise._



### Agriculture & Food Systems
- [Earlier Planting Fails to Replicate Historical Production Conditions for US Spring Wheat](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02716-0) ‚Äî Savalkar et al., *Communications Earth & Environment*, 2025  
  _Shows that planting earlier will not offset heat stress impacts on U.S. spring wheat; 67% of wheat production regions remain highly vulnerable._

### Climate Effects (Tipping Points)
- [High probability of triggering climate tipping points under current policies modestly amplified by Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22027834/High.probability.of.triggering.climate.tipping.points.under.current.policies.modestly.amplified.by.Amazon.dieback.and.permafrost.thaw.pdf)
(https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-16-565-2025) ‚Äî Deutloff, Held & Lenton, *Earth System Dynamics*, 2025  
  _This paper examined how under SSP2-4.5 there exists a critical threshold where carbon emissions from tipping elements (TEs) begin to balance and amplify anthropogenic CO‚ÇÇ emissions. The authors assessed probabilities of different TEs being triggered across scenarios, showing that SSP1-1.9 carries relatively low risk, whereas SSP2-4.5 exhibits a high probability of abrupt or even catastrophic tipping, making it an especially dangerous pathway. They conclude that SSP2-4.5 represents a paradoxical state: while not the highest-emission scenario, it locks the Earth system into long-term warming as TEs such as Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw continue driving feedbacks over the next 500 years. In contrast, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 reflect outright planetary destruction, where TEs merely accelerate an already devastating trajectory.

- [Increasing risk of global forest loss from extreme wildfires under climate change.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22027581/Increasing.risk.of.global.forest.loss.from.extreme.wildfires.under.climate.change.pdf)
Citation: Huang, K., Wu, X., Zhang, L., Geng, H., & Qu, Y. (2025). Increasing risk of global forest loss from extreme wildfires under climate change. International Journal of Digital Earth, 18(1), 2483982. https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2025.2483982
Summary:
This paper highlighted how, over the study period from 2011‚Äì2023, both the volume and size of wildfires have been increasing, with the most pronounced changes occurring in the Boreal Forest. Burned volume has risen most in the Northern Hemisphere (40‚Äì60¬∞N), while fire size has expanded most in the Southern Hemisphere (10‚Äì30¬∞S). The authors also noted an increase in new forest growth in cooler, wetter northern regions; however, these areas become additional fuel sources during recurring hot‚Äìdry anomalies, which typically last 1‚Äì2 years. To conclude, the paper underscores a critical issue not only for wildlife and global forest stability, but also for broader ecosystem and agricultural resilience, as similar dynamics may manifest in crop systems.


### Climate Sensitivity
- [Seeing the Forest for the Trees](https://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2025/ForestTrees.06August2025.pdf) ‚Äî Hansen & Kharecha, 2025  
  _Argues that equilibrium climate sensitivity is closer to 4.8¬∞C for doubled CO‚ÇÇ, far higher than IPCC‚Äôs central estimate, due to underestimated cloud feedbacks._
